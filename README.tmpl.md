I enjoy contributing to various awesome projects in different ways. I am *not* a full-time software developer, but still enjoy trying different programming and scripting languages and to always try something new. Beside that, there's probably not really much new things I could tell you here: Check out the profile description on the left or the GitHub history below to get more an idea what I'm working on.
